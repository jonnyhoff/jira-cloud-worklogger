README
======

This command line tool let's you log the time that you've spent on one or more
JIRA issues without the need to click through the JIRA web interface. We allow
you to log the time either automatically (with a timer) or manually (by entering
how much time you've spent in words, e.g. `1h`, `30m`).

Installation
------------

Install `jira-worklogger` from pip using this command:

```console
$ python -m pip install jira-worklogger
```

Demo
----

First time setup and automatic time logging
-------------------------------------------

This demonstration shows how `jira-worklogger` is set up for the first time and
then used to track the time you spent on a JIRA issue automatically. For this,
select at least one issue from your open issues list start the timer. Leave the
terminal open and start working on your issue. When you're done with your work,
come back and press any key to stop the time and log the time in JIRA togethe
with an optional comment.

Manual time logging
-------------------

The following demo shows how you can show your issues from a pre-configure JIRA
Server and select one to track the time manually. This is done by giving a
duration like `1h` for one hour or `20m` for twenty minutes.

Advanced usage and "did"
------------------------

The following demo shows how to work on multiple issues with different tracking methods
as well as how to show your work log using the [did](https://github.com/psss/did) tool.
NOTE: At the time of writing this [my pr](https://github.com/psss/did/pull/429) was not
yet merged into did.

Result in JIRA
--------------

In JIRA the result from the two time logs will look like this:

Usage
-----

### Jira Cloud API token

When configuring a Jira Cloud site choose the "Jira Cloud - Email and API token"
authentication option. You will be asked for your Atlassian account email address
and an API token. Create or manage API tokens at
<https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens>.

### Personal access token (PAT)

For Jira Server and Data Center instances choose the "Jira Server / Data Center -
Personal Access Token" option. To acquire a personal access token you have to go to
`https://<YOUR_JIRA_SERVER>/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?selectedTab=com.atlassian.pats.pats-plugin:jira-user-personal-access-tokens`.

For the Red Hat issues, that is [here](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?selectedTab=com.atlassian.pats.pats-plugin:jira-user-personal-access-tokens).

> **Security note:** The credentials you enter during setup are written to
> `~/.config/jira-worklogger/jira-worklogger.conf` in plain text.

### Controlling which issues appear

Each server configuration now stores the JQL that seeds the initial issue list.
During setup you can accept the default (`assignee=currentUser() AND statusCategory not in (Done)`) or supply any
query that matches the issues you typically log time against. Existing
configurations can be updated manually by adding an `issue_jql = ...` line to the
corresponding section in `~/.config/jira-worklogger/jira-worklogger.conf`.

While picking issues, use the new "Search Jira" options to pull in additional
issues on demand. The keyword search scans summaries/descriptions (and accepts
issue keys), and the custom JQL option lets you paste any query before returning
to the selection list.
